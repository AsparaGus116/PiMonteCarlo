Little demo app for finding pi by testing whether randomly distributed points fall into or out of a circle that's inscribed in a square. The ratio will be pi for a unit circle.

Accuracy can be increased by increasing the framerate and number of iterations per draw call, but this is highly inefficient regardless, and is only meant for good graphical visualization, not accuracy.
